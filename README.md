# BasicLanDetection
A very basic lan detection system using open cv and python2

In basic lne line detection i have used 
1.region masking
2.Color based detection
  -for yellow lines HSV based detection is used
3.Canny edge detection
4.Hough transform

after performing above steps we will get segmented lines. 
Note:Change in luminosity will requirer to make changes in parameter to get accurate results.
